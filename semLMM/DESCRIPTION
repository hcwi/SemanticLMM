Description: Allows to build a semantic model of a linear mixed model (LMM) analysis.
    Provides classes that represent the basic components of a linear mixed model. Allows to export 
    the semantic model of LMM as RDF, and save to TriG files. For LMM data analysis done with lme4 
    and nlme packages, parses the resulting model object and builds the semantic model.
