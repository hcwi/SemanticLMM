This is a demo instruction on how to produce a semantic model in the form of RDF triples from a result of statistical modelling with R packages: lme4 and nlme.
The code used for graph generation supports a subset of modelling cases possible in these packages.

# R lme4

### Define a dataset

```{r}
y <- as.numeric(c(6, 4, 5, 6, 9, 3))
Treatment <- as.factor(c("T1","T1","T2","T2","T3","T3"))
Block <- as.factor(c("B1","B2","B1","B2","B1","B2"))

df <- data.frame(y, Treatment, Block)
print(df)

```
### Define a statistical model of type lmer (from lme4 package)
```{r}
require(lme4)
mod <- lmer(y ~ 0 + Treatment + (1|Block), data = df)
summary(mod)
```

### Build an annotated model from a statistical model
```{r}
getwd()
source("../lmm_classes.R")
modelFitting <- exportModelToRDF(mod)
```

### Serialize the annotated model as RDF triples, forming a semantic model of the lmer analysis
```{r}
modelFitting$saveTriples()
```
